# Portfolio - Web Designer and Developer

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Simon Mulenga, a third-year Business Administration with Economics student at the University of Zambia. I am passionate about coding and developing systems that make people's work easier and more efficient.

## Experience

- I have worked with Zambart, where I created databases for the lab department. These databases enable them to register received samples, track tests conducted, manage inventories, and generate invoices. This system streamlines their workflow and improves overall efficiency.
- Additionally, I have created a database for the Governance department, which helps track billable time for projects and generates accurate invoices based on the time spent.

## Projects

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my web design and development projects. These projects showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks. I specialize in creating responsive websites, interactive user interfaces, and custom web applications.
